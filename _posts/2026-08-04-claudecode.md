Agentic AI tools are transforming how developers write, refactor, and debug software directly from their terminals and IDEs. If you are running **Linux Mint** and looking to build a clean, powerful, privacy-respecting AI development environment, this comprehensive guide walks through everything you need to know—from setting up Anthropic’s **Claude Code** and the open-source **OpenCode** CLI to choosing and configuring your code editor.

---

## 1. What is Claude Code?

**Claude Code** is Anthropic's agentic AI coding tool designed specifically for terminal-first workflows. Unlike standard chat interfaces where you copy and paste snippets back and forth, Claude Code operates directly within your local workspace environment.

### Key Features & Capabilities
* **Full Repository Awareness:** Automatically reads project structure, local configurations, and codebase dependencies to maintain context.
* **Direct Execution & Editing:** Modifies multi-file codebases, runs test suites, and executes shell commands locally to verify its work.
* **Autonomous Error Correction:** Detects failed test runs or compiler errors, analyzes the diagnostic output, and applies fixes independently.
* **Custom Project Context (`CLAUDE.md`):** Uses a root repository file to remember system architecture, style preferences, and testing routines.
* **Tooling Integration:** Works seamlessly with Model Context Protocol (MCP), GitHub Actions, and custom hooks/skills.

## 2. Installing Claude Code on Linux Mint

Setting up Claude Code on Linux Mint (or any Debian/Ubuntu-based distribution) can be completed using either a standalone binary or `npm`.

### Method A: Standalone Native Installer (Recommended)
This approach installs a self-contained binary into `~/.local/bin` without requiring a Node.js runtime.

```bash
# Download and install the standalone binary
curl -fsSL [https://claude.ai/install.sh](https://claude.ai/install.sh) | bash

# Ensure ~/.local/bin is present in your PATH
echo $PATH

# If missing, add it to your ~/.bashrc file
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

# Verify installation
claude --version

```

### Method B: Global Installation via `npm`

If you prefer Node.js management, ensure Node 22+ is installed via **Node Version Manager (nvm)** to avoid using `sudo npm`.

```bash
# Install nvm and Node.js 22
curl -o- [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh) | bash
source ~/.bashrc
nvm install 22
nvm use 22

# Install Claude Code globally
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

```

### Essential Mint Dependencies

To optimize terminal file searches and Git tracking, install system helpers:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y git ripgrep

```

## 3. Editor Setup: VS Code vs. VSCodium

Choosing the right code editor depends on your stance on open-source software and telemetry tracking.

### VS Code vs. VSCodium Comparison

| Feature | Visual Studio Code (VS Code) | VSCodium |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **License** | Proprietary Microsoft License | 100% Open Source (MIT) |
| **Telemetry** | Enabled by default | Fully stripped out |
| **Extension Market** | Official Microsoft Marketplace | Open VSX Registry |
| **Claude Code Setup** | Direct 1-click install | Extension VSIX download or Terminal CLI |

### Installing VS Code on Linux Mint

```bash
wget -qO- [https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc](https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc) | gpg --dearmor > packages.microsoft.gpg
sudo install -D -o root -g root -m 644 packages.microsoft.gpg /etc/apt/keyrings/packages.microsoft.gpg
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd64,arm64,armhf signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/packages.microsoft.gpg] [https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/code](https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/code) stable main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/vscode.list'
rm -f packages.microsoft.gpg

sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y code

```

### Installing VSCodium on Linux Mint

```bash
wget -qO - [https://gitlab.com/paulcarroty/vscodium-deb-rpm-repo/raw/master/pub.gpg](https://gitlab.com/paulcarroty/vscodium-deb-rpm-repo/raw/master/pub.gpg) | gpg --dearmor | sudo dd of=/usr/share/keyrings/vscodium-archive-keyring.gpg
echo 'deb [ signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/vscodium-archive-keyring.gpg ] [https://download.vscodium.com/debs](https://download.vscodium.com/debs) vscodium main' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/vscodium.list

sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y codium

```

### Integrating Claude Code with Your Editor

1. **Integrated Terminal Method (Universal):** Launch `code .` or `codium .` in your terminal, open the built-in terminal (`Ctrl + ~`), and run:
```bash
claude

```


2. **VS Code GUI Extension:** Press `Ctrl + Shift + X`, search for **Claude Code** by Anthropic, and click **Install**.
3. **VSCodium Manual VSIX Install:** Download the `.vsix` file from the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=anthropic.claude-code), open VSCodium, navigate to Extensions (`Ctrl + Shift + X`), click the `...` menu at the top right, and select **Install from VSIX...**.

---

## 4. Installing and Using OpenCode

**OpenCode** is a popular open-source, terminal-based AI coding assistant that supports multiple model providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, local Ollama models, and custom endpoints).

### Installation Options

#### Option 1: Official Shell Script (Recommended)

```bash
curl -fsSL [https://opencode.ai/install](https://opencode.ai/install) | bash
source ~/.bashrc
opencode --version

```

#### Option 2: Package Managers (`npm` or `bun`)

```bash
# Via npm
npm install -g opencode-ai

# Via bun
bun install -g opencode-ai

```

#### Option 3: Desktop App (.deb package)

Download the `.deb` release file from the official repository and install via APT:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y ./opencode*.deb

```

### Getting Started with OpenCode

1. Open your project directory: `cd /path/to/project`
2. Start the agent: `opencode`
3. Configure your API key or model host inside the interface using `/connect`.

## Summary Workflow

With these tools installed, you have a modern, privacy-focused Linux terminal environment capable of handling complex software engineering tasks autonomously. You can run `claude` or `opencode` directly in your workspace terminal, or run them within the integrated terminal of VS Code or VSCodium for real-time visual inspection of file modifications.

```
